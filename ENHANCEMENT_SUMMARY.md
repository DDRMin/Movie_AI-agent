## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### Memory System Enhancements
```python
# Session management with unique IDs
session_id = os.getenv("USER_SESSION_ID", str(uuid.uuid4())[:8])

# Enhanced memory configuration
self.memory = Mem0Memory(
    config={
        "api_key": mem0_api_key,
        "user_id": f"ai_agent_user_{session_id}",
        "app_id": "ai_agent_app",
        "version": "v1.0"
    }
)

# Message classification for better organization
def _classify_message(self, message: str) -> str:
    # Categorizes messages as movie_query, calculation, etc.
```

### Enhanced Tools
1. **Advanced Memory Search**: Better formatting and error handling
2. **Memory Summary Tool**: Get overviews of recent conversations
3. **Improved Movie Tool**: Expanded database with better suggestions
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: More helpful feedback to users

### User Experience Improvements
- **Detailed Startup Information**: Shows available features and memory status
- **Help Command**: Provides examples of how to use each feature
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages
- **Status Indicators**: Shows which features are active vs. configured

## 📋 Usage Examples
