# AI and Machine Learning Knowledge Base

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Types of Machine Learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics, Autonomous vehicles
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Neural Networks**: Networks of interconnected nodes (neurons)
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for training neural networks
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Excellent for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Good for sequential data
- **Transformers**: State-of-the-art for natural language processing

### Applications:
